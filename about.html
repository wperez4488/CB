		<h1> The Backstory </h1>
			<p> After I returned home to the East Village following Hurricane Sandy I was struck by something: all the people in my neighborhood that spent the week alone in dark, cold apartments because they had nowhere to go. I was fortunate that my company put me up in a hotel, but many elderly were cut off since there was no power or anyone checking in on them.</p>
			
			<p> The lack of access was isolating, not to mention frightening. I also remember the panicked feeling on 9/11. Cell phones were't working and communication was difficult admist the chaos, fear and confusion of that day.</p>
			<p> I wanted to create a system that would ensure people, all people, young, old, new residents and old timers, would have someone watching out for them. Whether you just moved to the city and don't know a soul, or have lived here a lifetime, being a buddy or having a buddy could make a difference in your or someone else's life.</p>
			<p>It's real easy. There is no commitment outside the understanding that, should anything go down, you'll make sure your buddy is "okay" and they, in turn, will have the reassurance of knowing you're out there.</p>

			<h3>Buddy Benefits</h3>
			<p> When you "Buddy-up" that benefits the community, too. You'll have the opportunity to meet other volunteers and their buddies at varioius events throughout the year, connect with more people in the neighborhood, and build new relationships.</p>
